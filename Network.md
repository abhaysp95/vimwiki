# Computer Network

A computer network is a `digital communication network` which allows `nodes` to share resources. In computer networks, `computing devices exchange data` with each other using data links between nodes. These datat links are established over `cable media` such as `twisted pair` or `fiber-optic cables`, and `wireless media` such as `Wi-Fi`.

## History

History of computer network and internet is very broad. We will get into that later.

## Properties

Computer network may be considered a branch of different engineering as well as some diploma courses, since it relies upon the theoratical and practical applications of the related disciplines.

A computer network may be used by `security hackers` to deploy _computer viruses_ or _computer worms_ and other malicious programs on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a **Denial of Service attack**.
