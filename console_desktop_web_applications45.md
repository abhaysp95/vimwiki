* User triggers a request to the web server over the internet, either though a browser or the application's user interface.
* Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server.
* Web application server performs the requested task - such as querying the database or processing the data - then generates the results of the requested data.
* Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
* Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user's display.
