- python is prerquisite for placement.
	* InfyTQ offers only python for problem solving.
	* Approx. all the placement companies offers Python Programming Language for solving the coding based questions.

# Introduction of Python

* The implementation of Python was started in the December, 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at  CWI in Netherland.
* He name it after the television show `Monty Python's Flying Circus`.
* It is high level programming language.
* Python uses interpreter for converting High Level language into low level language.
* Python is case sensitive.
* Free and open source.

## Data type in python -

In python data type doesn't matters. You can put any value in a variable in python.

## Identifiers in python

- Any keyword can't be identifier
- Don't give space in variable name(you can use special characters)
- There are almost 33 keywords in python eg,. True, None, for, while,
- Special literal in python None(same as NULL in c)
- Input functions is identified by default as string.
- Two new operator in python
	* % = To return remainder after division modulus
	* // = prints the int part of division
	* ** = this is basically exponent like 2**3=8
- syntax of if
```py
	if condition:
		true
	else:
		false
```
	or to put ladder

```py
	if condition-1:
		statement-1
	elif condition-2:
		statement-2
	...
	elif  condition-n:
		statement-n
	else:
		default statement
```

- Comments in pyhon is given by #
- Can't use `-` in python
- Python returns `true` or `false` in decision making
- There is no increment operator in python(++,--)
- There is new operator <> similar to (!= not equal to) doesn't works in python 3
- Assignment operators
	* =		assignment
	* /=	divide and assign
	* +=	add and assign
	* -=
	* **=
	* %=
	* //=

- Logical Operators are	`and`, `or` & `not` (written in same way)
- `in`		Returns true if a variable is in sequence of another variable, else false.
- `not in`	Returns true if a variable is not in sequence of another variable, else
- `is`		Returns true if identity of two operands are true, else false
- `not is`	Reverse of _is_

Learn for modules or objects by using `dir`, like this

```py
	>>> import random
```

Python interpreter also has help command which displays the section from the python docs related to the name you're interested in.

```py
	>>> help(random.randint)
```
