# SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)

`SDLC` is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The `SDLC` aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

* _SDLC_ is the acronym for Software Development Life Cycle.
* It is also called as Software Development Process
* _SDLC_ is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.
* _ISO/IEc 12207_ is an international standard for software life-cycle process. It aims to be the standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintating software.

Here are the typical stages for the representation of SDLC-

- Planning
- Defining
- Designing
- Building
- Testing
- Deployment

## SDLC Models

There are various softwares development life cycles models defined and designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as **Software Development Process Models**. Each process follow a series of steps unique to it type to ensure success in the process of software development. F

Following are the models-
* Waterfall model
* Iterative model
* Spiral model
* V-model
* Big Bang model
